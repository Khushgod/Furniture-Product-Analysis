3. STATISTICAL INSIGHTS & INTERPRETATIONS
========================================================================

3.1 KEY FINDINGS FROM PREDICTIVE MODELING:
- Linear Regression slightly outperforms Random Forest (R² = 1.3% vs -2.7%)
- Title length is the most important feature (40.98% importance)
- Original price and discount factors contribute ~53% of predictive power
- Product categories have minimal impact on sales prediction

3.2 KEY FINDINGS FROM CORRELATION ANALYSIS:
- Perfect correlation exists between original price and discount amount (r = 0.941)
- Strong pricing consistency maintained (original price ↔ current price: r = 0.837)
- Sales volume is the primary revenue driver (r = 0.767)
- Price sensitivity is virtually non-existent in this market (r = -0.058)
- Discount effectiveness is minimal (r = 0.121)

3.3 BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY:
- Customer behavior appears to be driven by factors not captured in current dataset
- Price competition may not be the optimal strategy in this furniture market
- Sales volume optimization should be the primary focus for revenue growth
- Quality, design, brand, and customer service likely drive purchase decisions
- Current discount strategy is not effectively driving sales volume
